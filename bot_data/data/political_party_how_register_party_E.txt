								HOW IS A POLITICAL PARTY REGISTERED
 
							
							How a party could politically get qualified as a recognized political party for the  purposes of elections?
							
								Calling for applications
							

								A political party is treated as a recognized political party for the purpose of election under the section 7 of the Parliamentary Elections Act No 1 of 1981 as amended by 
						  Parliamentary Elections (Amendments) Act No 58 of 2009. 

								The Elections Commission publishes a newspaper notice before January 31 every year (if the law has not directed otherwise) calling for applications. However, if an election is announced during the month of January, the notice is published after the lapse of 
								30 days from the date of poll of such election.
							

								The application to get a political party recognized should be submitted to the 
								Election commission by the secretary of the party.
							

								What are the documents to be submitted with the applications?
							




								  1
							  

								    Copy of the constitution of the party.
							    



										2
									

										The list of office-bearers of the party (at least one female office-bearer should be included).
									



										3
									

										Statements of audited accounts of the party.
									



										4
									

										The current policy declaration of the party.
									



										5
									

										All documents and reports to prove that the party has been politically active continuously.
									


								Provisions in the Act may be referred to, for details.
