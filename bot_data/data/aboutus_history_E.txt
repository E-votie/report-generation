								OUR HISTORY
	




Beginnings and the evolution of the Department of Elections




It is a practice  before and  after Independence  and continued  todate, to establish departments, ministries, other state entities and statutory institutions for the purpose of running the functions and general services of the public sector. The commencement of the Department of Elections was yet another event in the same practice . The key objectives of the establishment of the Department of Elections were to administer electoral procedures and to carry out its management functions. In other words the key responsibility of the Department was to   carry out statutory an non-statutory functions including  the  conducting of free and fair elections and the preparation of  the Annual Voters Register.
The Department of Elections was established on the 1st of October, 1955. However, it was not one single event. A study  of the situation prior to the establishment of the Department will be of  importance in  gaining knowledge on its historical development.






Period before the establishment of the Department of Elections




The origins of representative democracy in Sri Lanka runs back to the 19th Century. Although no wide practice of elections could be observed  at that time, a fraction of the people in the country had received the opportunity of casting  vote for the first time at an election held for the purpose of electing members to the Colombo  Municipal Council under the  Ordinance No. 17 of 1865. Election of people's representatives to the legislature was initiated under  the Crewe McCallum Reforms 1911 to elect four representatives by vote.  That was when the number  of members of  the Legislative Council  increased to  21 representatives under the Crewe McCallum Reforms introduced in 1910  the Legislative Council consisted of 11 non-official and 10 official members. Four of the non-official members were appointed by limited franchise conducted in 1911  i.e. 2 Europeans (rural and urban), 1 Burgher and 1 Ceylonese.
The Legislative Council initially established in 1833  under the Colebrooke  Reforms consisted of 15  members  i.e  9 official and 6 non-official, but there were no elected members. The six non-official members  appointed  by the Governor were 3 Europeans, 1 Sinhalese, 1 Tamil and 1 Burgher.
The Legislative Council established in 1920 under Manning Devonshire Reforms consisted of 37 members i.e. 14 official and 23 non-official members. Five (5) non-official members were appointed by vote on electorate basis.
Forty nine (49) members were appointed to the Legislative Council established in 1924 under the  Orders in  Council 1923. It consisted of 12 official and 37 non-official members. 23 out of the non-official members were elected by area based election.
According to the  above  information, 3 elections have been conducted during the period 1910-1930 and three constitutional reforms  have made provisions for conducting such elections. They were,
1. Legislative Council Ordinance 1910
2. Ceylon (Legislative Council) Order in Council 1920
3. Ceylon (Legislative Council) Order in Council 1923 
         Members were elected at these elections in the order of the  number of votes obtained.
        No demarcation  of electorates was carried out by a Delimitation Commission for electing members. Following criteria  were  employed for the purpose of election. Neither the   area of land nor the amount of population have been taken into account in these elections.
1. Using administrative land units
    Eg. -  Provinces or revenue districts
2. Demarcation  based on community groups
    Eg. -  European (Rural), European (Urban), Burgher etc.
3. Sinhala and Tamil divisions (subsequently)
4. Employment or profession
    Eg. - Members of the Chamber of Commerce/ Members of Manufacturing Companies etc.
Various factors  have been taken into account as bases and qualifications of voters during this period as follows;
1. Division of electorates was on ethnic  basis.
2. Knowledge in the English language as a qualification.
3. Residence  for a one year period before   1st June of the year and a continuous residence of 6 months out of the said one year period.
4. Annual income of Rs. 600/- and possession of an asset/immovable property worth Rs. 1500/-.
Qualifications as well as disqualifications for voters were specified. Accordingly, the males   below 21 years of age, all females,  persons  of unsound mind  or having served a prison term or subject to death  penalty etc. did not get franchise.
 
Qualifications to be Candidates
It was not sufficient that candidates were registered as voters. One should not carry any disqualification to be a candidate and they should have a  period of residence of 3 years in the area. They should not be having served a prison term of over 3 years.  Being below 25 years of age, being employed in public service or dismissed from public service etc. were the  disqualifications.  The level of income had also been considered under Section 13(2) of 1920 Ordinance.
Voter's Registers were prepared.. Registration officers were appointed by the Governor,  the highest administrator of the country.  The Registration officers prepared the Voters Register. Persons holding   posts such as Government Agents, Assistant Government Agents, and Revenue Officers were appointed as Registration officers.
All these matters were administered and managed under the orders of the Governor. He  made arrangements to select and appoint the staff such as Returning Officers and Polling Officers. Registration officers  enumerated the voters. Returning Officers  carried out  all activities such as the poll and  the announcement of results. In addition,  provisions had been made on election offences and corruption  and this was an  important feature in the election process.





State Council System (1931 – 1947)




The State Council was established as per 1931 Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council under Donoughmore Constitution. Action was taken to follow provisions in the 1931 Ceylon (State Council) Order in Council to appoint members to the State Council.  Two Elections were conducted   in 1931 and 1936.  The next election was not conducted due to the Second World War. Therefore,  the term of office of the Second State Council had  to be extended and continued for a period of 11 years. The Governor appointed a Delimitation Commission in 1930 and the Commission demarcated 50 constituencies based on provinces. It was designed to appoint one member each for a population of 100,000 - 125,000. The 50 constituencies were,

Eastern Province

Southern Province

North Western Province

Under the Donoughmore Reforms voters register was prepared by the  Registering Officer appointed by the Governor.  Franchise was offered to both males and females over 21 years of age. Universal franchise is identified as the free right exercised by every citizen over the specified age limit, not subject to legal disqualifications. The legislations required for this purpose and  for a new electoral process and management  were newly introduced. Operation of electoral process was conducted as before by the Returning Officers under the instructions and orders of the Governor.
Party symbols were not used on ballot papers at the elections conducted in 1931 and 1936. The use of ballot boxes in different colours for each candidate and   the voter getting  the opportunity to cast his vote for the candidate of  his  choice by inserting the ballot into the box of the candidate were the special characteristics of this election. This was a sound alternative to the question of iliteracy of the vast number of voters newly added after granting franchise to everybody over 21 years of age without considering  education  as a qualification to cast vote.






Period of 1947 – 1955




The Department of Elections   was established and a Commissioner was appointed to conduct the Parliamentary Election, 1947 after the enactment of the 1946 Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council.  The Local Authorities Ordinance 1946 was enacted and the  Local Authorities Elections Department was established under another Commissioner for Local Authorities Election.   Members of Parliament and Members of Local Authorities were elected  from 1947 to 1955, by the  two departments.  The first Parliamentary Election 1947 and the second Parliamentary Election 1952 were conducted by the Department of Parliamentary Elections. Local Authority Elections were  conducted  by the Department of Local Authorities Elections.





Establishment of the Department of Elections




Department of Elections was established on  the 1st October, 1955   amalgamating the Department of Parliamentary Elections and Department of Local Authorities Elections. It was headed by the Commissioner of Elections. 
The vision and responsibility of the Department of Elections  to conduct free and fair elections  and referendums and to prepare voters  register required for the purpose in order to protect people's sovereignty and democracy. The Commissioner and the Department of Elections have been particularly vested with independence which was not observed in any other government entity from the days of the inception.
The independence of the Department  of Election has been preserved by not placing it under the purview of any ministry, by not  appointing or removing officers in the department without the consent of the Commissioner of Elections, by  making  provisions for the  Commissioner  to operate  independently  and  by not  influencing the department in any manner.  The Commissioner of Elections is responsible only to the Judiciary.  These are the characteristics of  the department that exhibit  independence in its operations vis a vis other state departments.
The principal duty of the Department of Elections is to take measures necessary to preserve franchise of citizens by conducting free and fair elections, registration of all qualified citizens annually  in the   electoral register as voters and prevention of entering names of disqualified persons.
Another key responsibility of the Department is to conduct Presidential and Parliamentary Elections,  referendums when the will of the people should be directly taken and conduct  Local Authorities Elections as specified by the Constitution in a free, fair and trustworthy manner.
The role of the Department of Elections may be summarized as follows.
(a)   To prepare and certify the Annual Register of Voters
(b)   At national level to conduct
          1. Presidential Elections
          2. Parliamentary General Elections and
          3. Referendums,
(c)       At provincial and local levels to conduct
          1. Provincial Council Elections, and
          2. Municipal Council, Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sabha Elections.
Legal provisions have been made to conduct all these elections by special Acts passed for each type of elections in addition to the provisions made by the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. They are as follows.
 I.   Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981
 II.  Referendum Act No. 7 of 1981
 III. Presidential Election Act No. 15 of 1981
 IV.  Provincial Council Elections Act No. 2 of 1988
 V.   Pradeshiya Sabha Act of 1980
 VI.  Local Authorities Elections  Act No. 2 of 1988
VII. The Registration of Electors Act No. 44 of 1980 facilitated all the elections by registering qualified voters.       
In addition to the above Acts, elections for the 24 Development Councils established with the Gazette notification under the Development Councils Act No. 35 of 1980, were held on 04.06.1981.
 Above Acts have granted statutory authority for the operation of electoral procedures pertaining to relevant elections. The entire administration and management thereunder inclusive of accepting nominations, operation of electoral procedures and the control of election offences and unlawful acts are pursued under the direction  of the Commissioner of Elections.
Legal provisions existed during the time of the  establishment of the Department of Elections in year 1955, to  conduct elections and  methodologies and administrative procedures followed in conducting such elections have changed from time to time.  It is appropriate to note such changes  together with the terms of offices of Commissioners who have served  the Department of Elections. Six (6) Commissioners of Elections had been in office before the establishment of  the Elections Commission
